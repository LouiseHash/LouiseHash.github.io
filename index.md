### Self Introduction
I am always finding a suitable niche for me, which could let me not only present technical skill but also satisfy my intrigue about analyzing information. As a result, pursuing a master degree in MSIS is my best solution. In this inter-discipline, I would like to accumulate discretion about data and information and enhance analytic technical skills to pursue my super matching position. Having a passion for data analytics, solid basic knowledge of computer science and software engineering, plus practical experience about the database and financial system, I am eager to position myself at the data engineering domain.
